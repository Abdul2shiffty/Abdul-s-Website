        <h2>Why Fortnite is Awesome</h2>
        <p>Fortnite is more than just a gameâ€”it's a cultural phenomenon. With its thrilling battle royale mode, creative building mechanics, and exciting updates, Fortnite keeps players coming back for more. Whether you're playing solo, in a duo, or teaming up in squads, Fortnite always offers something new to explore.</p>

        <h2>How I Found Fortnite</h2>
        <p>I first discovered Fortnite through my friend <span class="highlight">Tosif</span> back in grade 7. He introduced me to the game, and from the very first match, I was hooked! I started playing during <span class="highlight">Chapter 5 Season 3</span>, and I've been playing ever since. Initially, I played on <span class="highlight">console</span> and later switched to Xbox Cloud, which allowed me to play Fortnite on a virtual PC. However, the lag from playing on Xbox Cloud made me realize that I need a real gaming PC to fully experience the game.</p>

        <h2>My Fortnite Journey</h2>
        <p>My journey with Fortnite has been filled with exciting moments and a lot of learning. From battling it out with friends to trying my best in ranked matches, Iâ€™ve grown a lot as a player. Although I'm still on my laptop and dealing with some lag, Iâ€™ve reached <span class="highlight">Platinum 2</span> in ranked, and Iâ€™m working hard to improve. My ultimate goal is to switch to a gaming PC, sharpen my skills, and maybe even go pro one day!</p>
